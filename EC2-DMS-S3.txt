WHAT IS INSTANCE?
# Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that lets you run virtual servers in the cloud.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what that means:
--------------------------------------------------
ðŸ”¹ What EC2 Does:
# Launch virtual machines (called EC2 instances)
# Choose your own operating system, CPU, RAM, and storage
# Run websites, applications, databases, or anything you'd run on a regular server
# Scale up/down depending on traffic or workload

ðŸ”¹ Why People Use EC2:
--------------------------
# No need to buy physical servers
# Pay only for what you use
# Can scale automatically
# Integrates easily with other AWS services like S3 (storage), RDS (databases), etc.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS RDS?
# RDS stands for Amazon Relational Database Service.
# RDS is a managed database service by AWS. 
# It makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud â€” without having to manually manage the database server.

ðŸ”¹ What It Does for You:
-------------------------------
# Handles backups, patching, and maintenance automatically

# Supports popular databases like:
1.MySQL
2.PostgreSQL
3.MariaDB
4.Oracle
5.SQL Server
6.Amazon Aurora (AWSâ€™s own high-performance engine)

# Takes care of high availability and scaling

ðŸ”¹ Why People Use It:
-------------------------
# Saves time and effort (you donâ€™t manage the database server directly)
# Built-in security (encryption, access control)
# Supports automatic failover and replication
# Works well with other AWS services (like EC2, Lambda, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Example:
-----------------
# Imagine youâ€™re building a web app with a login system. You could:
# Run the app on EC2
# Store user data (like usernames and passwords) in a MySQL database managed by RDS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS DMS?
# DMS stands for AWS Database Migration Service.
# AWS DMS helps you migrate databases quickly and securely â€” with minimal downtime â€” to AWS.

ðŸ”¹ What It Can Do:
---------------------
# Migrate on-premises databases to AWS
# Migrate from one database engine to another (e.g., Oracle â†’ PostgreSQL)
# Replicate data continuously for real-time sync
# Works with databases like:
1.MySQL, PostgreSQL
2.Oracle, SQL Server
3.MongoDB, Amazon Aurora, and more

ðŸ”¹ Why It's Useful:
-----------------------
# You donâ€™t need to stop your app â€” it keeps running during the migration
# Super helpful for moving to RDS, Aurora, or Redshift
# Handles schema conversion, data type mapping, and ongoing replication

ðŸ”¹ Example Use Case:
----------------------
# Letâ€™s say you have a MySQL database running on your local server, and you want to move it to Amazon RDS for MySQL. DMS will:
# Connect to your source DB
# Migrate the data to RDS
# Keep syncing any new changes until you're ready to cut over

SOME MYSQL COMMANDS USE IN OS(LINUX)
--------------------------------------
SHOW DATABASES;                  -- List all databases
CREATE DATABASE db_name;         -- Create a database
USE db_name;                     -- Switch to a database
DROP DATABASE db_name;           -- Delete a database
SHOW TABLES;                     -- List tables in the current database
DESCRIBE table_name;             -- Show structure of a table
CREATE TABLE table_name (...);   -- Create a new table
DROP TABLE table_name;           -- Delete a table
SELECT * FROM table_name;               -- Show all data in a table
INSERT INTO table_name (...) VALUES (...); -- Add new data
UPDATE table_name SET ... WHERE ...;    -- Update data
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE ...;       -- Delete data


WHILE WE CONNECTING THE RDS IN LINUX SERVER 
----------------------------------------------
# SUDO YUM UPDATE -Y            ----- # Update all packages
# SUDO YUM INSTALL MARIADB105   ------ # Install MariaDB 10.5 client (used to connect to MySQL/MariaDB servers)
# mysql -h <target-endpoint-host> -P<PORT_NUMBER> -u <user> -p    ------ # Connect to the MySQL/MariaDB server (replace with real values
# EXIT      --- # Exit the MySQL client when you're done
